### 🧩 About Me

I'm a 3rd-year Electrical & Electronics Engineering student at Bilkent University, passionate about designing intelligent physical agents and pushing the boundaries of learning algorithms. My long-term goal is to build complete humanoid robots—both physically and cognitively—by combining control systems, learning theory, and real-world robotics.

### 🔭 What I’m Working On
- 🤖 **Task and Motion Planning for Physical Manipulation** using the RAI framework (LiRA Lab, Bilkent University)
- 📈 **AI-Augmented Algorithmic Trading Bot** leveraging RL, NLP-based sentiment analysis, and market structure
- 🧠 **Traffic Optimization** through Reinforcement Learning, Control Theory, and Game Theory
- 📄 Collaborating on multiple **academic research papers** in robotics and intelligent systems (in progress)
- 🧪 Preparing for a **summer research internship at Yale University**, focusing on physics-informed neural networks for optimization
