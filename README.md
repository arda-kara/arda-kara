### 🧩 About Me

I design **intelligent large-scale systems that actually run in the real world**—from distributed quantum compilers to multi-agent traffic control, federated learning infrastructures, and low-latency trading systems.

Currently, I work at **Yale University SmartNets Lab**, co-developing one of the world’s first **fully concurrent Distributed Quantum Compiler architectures**, alongside scalable federated / split-learning systems for physics-informed models under severe memory constraints.

I care about **system design, control, infrastructure, and decisional intelligence** far more than toy demos or incremental ML projects. My work sits at the intersection of:
- Quantum networks & distributed compilers  
- Multi-agent control & game-theoretic systems  
- Federated/split learning & large-scale ML systems  
- Low-latency trading infrastructure and decision pipelines

### 🔭 What I’m Working On

- 🧬 **Distributed Quantum Compiler (DQC)**  
  Non-monolithic, asynchronous compiler integrating qubit mapping, routing, and entanglement resource allocation across multi-QPU networks.

- 🌍 **Federated & Split Learning for Physics-Informed Models**  
  Distributed seismic inversion learning with hybrid federation and split strategies under extreme device constraints.

- 🚦 **Stabilizing Human Traffic Without Autonomous Vehicles**  
  Demonstrating decentralized human-behavior controllers suppress phantom jams (submitted to IFAC 2026).

- 💸 **Helios: Distributed Trading Infrastructure**  
  Modular multi-agent trading backend + ultra-low-latency event-driven engine.

- 🤖 **Decentralized Robot Swarms & Auction-Based Multi-Robot Planning**  
  Federated policy learning + VCG allocation schemes.
